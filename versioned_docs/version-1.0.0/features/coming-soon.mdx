## Current Approved Features ðŸ”‘

### API Key Management

Access to your product shouldn't be limited to humans.
With this feature add **API Key Management** to your product with ease, and enable
your developers to **create**, **rollout**, **delete** and **assign** different permissions for different API Keys,
providing secure developer access.

### Impersonation

More often than not, you need to see your application with the eyes of your users.
Impersonation provides an easy to use "**view as**" capability.

	frameborder="0"
	allowfullscreen="true"
	allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share"
></iframe>
<br />

### Permission Requests

Allow your users to **request permissions** to features, resources or other assets they don't have access to.
Manage requests across the application in your back-office, and allow users with the correct permissions to approve those requests.

	allowfullscreen="true"
	allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share"

<br />

### Approval Flows

Access shouldn't be flat - protect critical paths with approval flows.
**Require users** to ask for **additional approval** from their team as part of a process (e.g. manager approving employee submissions).
