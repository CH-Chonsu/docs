In this tutorial, we will show you how to integrate Permit.io with your Application in just a few simple steps.

### Setup your PDP (Policy Decision Point) Container

We provide you with a **Policy-Decision-Point** - aka an authorization microservice, as a container for you to use.
Please follow the steps below to **install** and **run** the container on your local machine.

#### 1. Pull our PDP container from Docker Hub

If you do not have Docker installed as of yet, **[click here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)** to install Docker.

```
docker pull permitio/pdp:latest
```

#### 2. Get the Permit.io API key

Navigate to the **[Project Management](https://app.permit.io/project-management)** page with the **Permit.io** web interface.
Find the active environment that is marked with a green dot on the icon. **Copy the Secret Key**.

	alt="Copy secret key from Projects management"
	data-zoomable

<br />
<br />

Alternatively, while anyhwere on the Permit.io web interface, click on your user icon in the top right of the screen, and
"**Copy SDK Secret Key**" from there.

#### 3. Run the container

Remember to **replace** `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with the **Secret Key** you have just obtained in the previous step.

```
docker run -p 7766:7000 --env PDP_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY> permitio/pdp
```

:::info
Congratulations! You should now have a PDP container running. You can always check the status of the container
by typing `docker ps` in your terminal.

Let's now add the Permit SDK to **[your app](/tutorials/Onboarding/connect-your-app)** or use the following demo example below.
