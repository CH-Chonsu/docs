Today we are excited to release a few major roadmap items, chief amongst them are **attribute-based access control support** (ABAC) as well as a new **major version of our API**.

## ABAC support

**Attribute-based access control** (or simply: **ABAC**) allows you to define access policies that are much more granular and powerful than RBAC.
Our innovation comes from abstracting away most of ABAC's complexities, making it more accessible to newcomers and less-technical users.

To learn how to work with ABAC, you can:

- [Read the tutorial](../features/policy-editor/abac/overview)
- [Watch a video tutorial](https://youtu.be/QCsWlsjEE5A)
- [Learn how to work directly with the ABAC API](../api/working-with-abac/overview)

## New API Major version - V2 (v2.0.0)

Our new API version offers a strict hierarchy of objects, consistency across terminology and was build to be much more convenient to use.

### Major changes

- **Strict hierarchy of objects** - Organizations contain Projects which contain Environments, which with few exceptions contain all objects you’re familiar with.
  We deprecated globally scoped objects to be more consistent with our data model.
- **URL structures** are now matched to the object hierarchy.
- **API keys** are now more granular, we will enable you in the near future to invite a peer to Permit with limited access.
- **Consistent terminology** - in V1 we had slugs, custom_ids and keys in various places, all meaning the same thing. In v2 they’ve all simply named keys.
- **Keys** - keys are immutable strings that are unique under their respective namespaces
  and can look like whatever you want. Keys can be used wherever unique ids (UUIDs) are used.
  They enable better looking URLs and simpler integration with your system’s native naming rules.
- **Bug Fixes** across the board, fixing object scoping issues (i.e: environment scoping), performance issues, inconsistent schemas, etc.

- Check out the [API reference](https://api.permit.io/v2/redoc) to learn how to work with the API
- If you are already using the V1 API, [here is a guide how to migrate](../api/v2-migration-guide).
