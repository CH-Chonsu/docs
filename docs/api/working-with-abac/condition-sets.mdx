Condition sets give you the flexibility of ABAC with the simplicity of RBAC.

:::info
Condition sets are sets of objects that represent logical elements in your system.
:::

There are currently **two types of condition sets** that you can work with:

1. **User Set** - defined as a set of users that match all the specified conditions.
2. **Resource Set** - defined as a set of resources that match all the specified conditions.

## Example of a User Set

:::tip US BASED EMPLOYEES
All users who are **located in the United States** and have the **role of an Employee**.

We will call this _**us_based_employees**_.
:::

## Example of a Resource Set

:::tip PRIVATE REPOSITORIES
All resources that are of the **type repository** and are **private**.

We will call this _**private_repos**_.
:::

We can then picture a matrix of assignment between user sets and resource sets. We placed a checkbox to indicate that **us_based_employees**
can perform **any action** on the **private_repos** resource.

|                          | Admin | Employee | Employee in the US |
| ------------------------ | ----- | -------- | :----------------: |
| **Private Repositories** |       |          |       **X**        |
| Marketing Materials      |       |          |                    |

## Creating a Condition Set

We will now view code examples of a condition set written for the above defined User and Resource Sets.

### User Set - US Based Employees

Notice how we want both conditions to be true, so we ended up using the **allOf** logical operator.

We have also specified the type of the condition set to be **userset**.

```javascript title="us_based_employees"
{
    "key": "us_based_employees",
    "name": "US based employees",
    "type": "userset",
    "conditions": {
        "allOf": [
            {
                "user.role": {
                    "equals": "employee"
                }
            },
            {
                "user.location": {
                    "in": [
                        "US"
                    ]
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

### Resource Set - Private Repositories

In this example of a resource set condition, the type changed to **resourceset**.

```javascript title="private_repos"
{
    "key": "private_repositories",
    "name": "Private Repositories",
    "type": "resourceset",
    "conditions": {
        "allOf": [
            {
                "resource.type": {
                    "equals": "repository"
                }
            },
            {
                "resource.access": {
                    "equals": [
                        "private"
                    ]
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

We have now successfully defined two condition sets. Let's learn how we can use them together and create a **[Condition Set Rule](condition-set-rules)**.
