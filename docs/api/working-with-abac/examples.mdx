title: Condition Set Rule Examples
---

### Example #1

#### Students that study at Stanford University and are not part of the part-time study scheme can rent University bicycles after 5pm.

First, lets define our conditions and actions.

**User Set** - Students who study at Stanford and are not part-time.<br/>
**Action** - Renting Bicycles.<br/>
**Resource Set** - All resources that are of type bicycle and can be rented after 5pm.

Now let's create a User Set and Resource Set through the API.

#### User Set

```javascript title="full_time_stanford_students"
{
    "key": "full_time_stanford_students",
    "name": "Full-time Stanford Students",
    "type": "userset",
    "conditions": {
        "allOf": [
            {
                "user.role": {
                    "equals": "student"
                }
            },
            {
                "user.education": {
                    "not": [
                        "part-time"
                    ]
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Resource Set

```javascript title="rent_bicycle_after_5"
{
    "key": "rent_bicycle_after_5",
    "name": "Rent Bicycles After 5PM",
    "type": "resourceset",
    "conditions": {
        "allOf": [
            {
                "resource.type": {
                    "equals": "bicycle"
                }
            },
            {
                "resource.availability": {
                    "greater-than-equals": [
                        "17"
                    ]
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Finally, let's define our condition rule:

```javascript
{
    "user_set": "full_time_stanford_students",
    "permissions": [
        "bicycle:rent"
    ],
    "resource_set": "rent_bicycle_after_5"
}
```
