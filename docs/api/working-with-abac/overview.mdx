title: Working with the ABAC API
---

The API now allows us to create **[ABAC](../../concepts/ABAC/introduction)** calls, which give much more flexibility when defining
rules for access-control. With this added functionality of creating your own conditions, which consist of **actions**, **roles** and
**attributes** that are being performed on a specific **resource** - we can very tightly enforce attribute-based access control policies.
