title: Working with the ABAC API
---

## Overview

The API now allows us to create **[ABAC](../../features/policy-editor/abac/overview)** calls, which give much more flexibility when defining
rules for access-control. With this added functionality of creating your own conditions, which consist of **actions**, **roles** and
**attributes** that are being performed on a specific **resource** - we can very tightly enforce attribute-based access control policies.

With the functionality of ABAC, we can now define **[Condition Set Rules](condition-set-rules)** that will be part of **[Condition Sets](condition-sets)** - but before we dive
into understanding how we would construct those conditions, we need to understand some vocabulary.

#### Sending API Requests

:::tip
Certain API calls will require you to provide the **Project ID** and **Environment ID** as part of the payload.
Previously, you had to make a separate API call to get this information, however, currently with the new version
of the API, you can directly pass in the **verbose versions** of the project name and environment name.
