### Example #1

#### We have a shared todo app that allows users to create, read, update, toggle and delete tasks.

First, lets define our roles resources and permissions.

**Roles** - Admin and Operator.<br/>
**Resource** - Task with create, read, update, toggle and delete actions.<br/>
**Permissions** - Admin can do everything and Operator can only read and toggle tasks.<br/>

Now let's create a Roles and Resources and Role Permissions through the API.<br/>
But before we need to get our `API_SECRET_KEY` from the dashboard and get current `project_id` and `env_id`<br/>
- [Follow this link to get your API_SECRET_KEY](/api/api-with-cli/#get-your-api-key).<br/>
- [To get your project_id and env_id follow this link](/api/examples/get-project-and-env).

After you got your `API_SECRET_KEY`, `project_id` and `env_id` you can create your roles, resources and role permissions.<br/>
Make sure to replace `API_SECRET_KEY`, `project_id` and `env_id` with your own values project_id and project_key are interchangeable the same apply to env_id and env_key.


```bash
# create an admin role
curl 'https://api.permit.io/v2/schema/project_id/env_id/roles' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY' \
  --data-raw '{"key":"admin","name":"admin","description":""}'

# create an operator role
curl 'https://api.permit.io/v2/schema/project_id/env_id/roles' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY' \
  --data-raw '{"key":"operator","name":"operator","description":""}'


# create a task resource with create, read, update, toggle and delete actions
curl 'https://api.permit.io/v2/schema/project_id/env_id/resources' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY' \
  --data-raw '{"key":"task","name":"task","actions":{"create":{"name":"create"},"read":{"name":"read"},"update":{"name":"update"},,"toggle":{"name":"toggle"},,"delete":{"name":"delete"}},"attributes":{}}' 


# create a role permission for admin
curl 'https://api.permit.io/v2/schema/project_id/env_id/roles/admin/permissions' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY' \
  --data-raw '{"permissions":["task:create","task:read","task:update","task:toggle","task:delete"]}'

# create a role permission for user
curl 'https://api.permit.io/v2/schema/project_id/env_id/roles/operator/permissions' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY' \
  --data-raw '{"permissions":["task:read","task:toggle"]}'
```

Now we have our roles, resources and role permissions created. Let's create a user and assign the user to the user role.

```bash
# create the first user (we will assign this user to the admin role)
curl 'https://api.permit.io/v2/facts/project_id/env_id/users' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY' \
  --data-raw '{"key":"unique_id_for_admin_username","email":"admin@domain.com","first_name":"","last_name":""}'

# create another user
'https://api.permit.io/v2/facts/project_id/env_id/users' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY' \
  --data-raw '{"key":"unique_id_for_username","email":"user@domain.com","first_name":"","last_name":""}'
```

Now we have our users created. Let's assign the admin user to the admin role and the user to the user role.

```bash
# assign the admin user to the admin role
curl 'https://api.permit.io/v2/facts/project_id/env_id/role_assignments' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY' \
  --data-raw '{"role":"admin","tenant":"default","user":"unique_id_for_admin_username"}'

# assign the operator role to the other operator
curl 'https://api.permit.io/v2/facts/project_id/env_id/role_assignments' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY' \
  --data-raw '{"role":"operator","tenant":"default","user":"unique_id_for_username"}'
```
