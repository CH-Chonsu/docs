Using the API directly is the most flexible way to integrate with the platform.
The API is a RESTful API that uses JSON for serialization and bearer tokens for authentication.
You can use any HTTP client in any programming language to interact with the API. or you can use the [official SDKs](/category/sdk).
You can also use CURL or PostMan to interact with the API.



#### Sending API Requests

:::tip
Certain API calls will require you to provide the **Project ID** and **Environment ID** as part of the payload.
Previously, you had to make a separate API call to get this information, however, currently with the new version
of the API, you can directly pass in the **verbose versions** of the project name and environment name.
