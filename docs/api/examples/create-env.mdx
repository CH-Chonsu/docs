# Overview

A Permit environment is a silo (logical grouping) of your policy (e.g. roles, conditions, etc.) and data (users, tenants, role assignments, etc.) . You can create multiple environments for each of your projects. For example, you can create a `production` environment for your production deployment and a `staging` environment for your staging deployment. Environments can be used for CI/D flows, testing, and more.
Each environment has its own access-control (yes, it's access control for your access-control :D )
You can create environments dynamically using the API.

For example you can create a `production` environment for your production users and a `staging` environment for your staging users. You can also create a `test` environment for your test users. You can create as many environments as you want for your project.


## Create Environment

:::warning Remember
Make sure you use an organization level api-key or project level api-key to create a new environment, and not the api-key of another environment. 
:::


First of all we need to get our `API_SECRET_KEY` from the dashboard and get current `project_id`<br/>
- [Follow this link to get your API_SECRET_KEY](/api/api-with-cli/#get-your-api-key).<br/>
- [To get your project_id](/api/examples/get-project-and-env).

Replace `API_SECRET_KEY` with your `API_SECRET_KEY` and `project_id` with your `project_id` in the following command.

```bash
curl 'https://api.permit.io/v2/projects/project_id/envs' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY'\
  --data-raw '{"key":"new-env-name","name":"New Env Name"}' 

# the return environment object will look like this:
#{
#    "key": "new-env-key",
#    "id": "f77b6ee3149e4b90ba3263ecd092xxxx",
#    "organization_id": "903ebc2765b848289d6dfbd3c21exxxx",
#    "project_id": "3c4244c7bcab4c97990e5bc724dafe85",
#    "created_at": "2023-07-30T15:56:21+00:00",
#    "updated_at": "2023-07-30T15:56:21+00:00",
#    "name": "New Env Name",
#    "description": null,
#    "custom_branch_name": null,
#    "jwks": null,
#    "settings": null
#}
```
