# createRole

Creates a new role.

### Parameters

`role` - An object that contains the information about the new role. The payload is defined below.<br/>

### Payload

`key` - A URL-friendly name of the role (i.e: slug). You will be able to query later using this key instead of the id (UUID) of the role.<br/>
`name` - The name of the role.<br/>
`description` - **optional** - The description string explaining what this role represents, or what permissions are granted to it.<br/>
`permissions` - **optional** - The list of action keys that define what actions this resource role is permitted to do.<br/>
`extends` - **optional** - The list of role keys that define what roles this role extends. In other words: this role will automatically inherit all the permissions of the given roles in this list.<br/>

```python
{
	"key": "editor",
	"name": "Editor",
	"description": "the editor role can read and write to documents",
	"permissions": ["document:write"],
	"extends": ["viewer"]
}
```

```python
response = await permit.api.create_role(role)
