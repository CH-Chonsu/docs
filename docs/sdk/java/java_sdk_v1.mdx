# Java SDK (V1)

:::caution
This is **version V1 of the Java SDK**.

V2 will offer much better support and integration within your projects. It should be out in the close coming weeks.
In the meanwhile, you are more than welcome to use the existing V1 SDK - which continues to work.

If you would like to use the V1 of the SDK, please find it **[here](/1.0.0/reference/SDKs/Java/quickstart_java)**.
