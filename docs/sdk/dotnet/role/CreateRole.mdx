# CreateRole

Creates a new role.

### Parameters

`role` - An object that contains the information about the new role. The payload is defined below.<br/>

`Key` - A URL-friendly name of the role (i.e: slug). You will be able to query later using this key instead of the id (UUID) of the role.<br/>
`Name` - The name of the role.<br/>
`Description` - **optional** - The description string explaining what this role represents, or what permissions are granted to it.<br/>
`Permissions` - **optional** - The list of action keys that define what actions this resource role is permitted to do.<br/>
`Extends` - **optional** - The list of role keys that define what roles this role extends. In other words: this role will automatically inherit all the permissions of the given roles in this list.<br/>

```dotnet
{
	Key: "editor",
	Name: "Editor",
	Description: "the editor role can read and write to documents",
	Permissions: ["document:write"],
	Extends: ["viewer"]
}
