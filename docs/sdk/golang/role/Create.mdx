# Create

Creates a new role.

### Parameters
`ctx` -  The context of the request.<br/>
`roleCreate` - An object that contains the information about the new role. The payload is defined below.<br/>

### Payload
`Key` - A URL-friendly name of the role (i.e: slug). You will be able to query later using this key instead of the id (UUID) of the role.

You will later pass this Key to the `permit.check()` API. You can use anything for this Key - the user email, a UUID or anything else as long as it's unique on your end. The user key must be url-friendly (slugified).<br/><br/>
`Name` - **optional** - The name of the role.
`Description` - **optional** - Description string explaining what this role represents, or what permissions are granted to it.<br/>
`Permissions` - **optional** - List of action keys that define what actions this resource role is permitted to do.<br/>
`Extends` - **optional** - List of role keys that define what roles this role extends. In other words: this role will automatically inherit all the permissions of the given roles in this list.<br/>

```go
roleCreate := models.NewRoleCreate("role-key", "role-name")
roleCreate.SetPermissions([]string{"resource-key:read", "resource-key:write"})
```

### Implementation
```go
role, err := Permit.Api.Roles.Create(ctx, *roleCreate)
```
