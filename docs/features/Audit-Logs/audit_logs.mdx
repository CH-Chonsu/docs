# Audit Logs

Knowing who has done what in your application is critical for multiple reasons, including security, compliance, debugging, and even just plain old monitoring.
Audit logs are a great way to track who did what, when, and why!
They are a useful tool both for you and your team as the maintainers of your application, but also your end-users, who want to track their own usage and actions within the app.

## Automatic Generation

As Permit.io powers your application, you are getting automatic audit logs.
Enforcement points, along with resource and action definitions, and user/tenant configurations automatically come together to generate the full picture needed for an audit log entry.

## Types of Audit Logs

There are two types of audit logs:
- Basic audit logs - these are the basic logs detailed above
- Decision Logs - more in depth logs reflecting "why" the policy engine made a decision

## How to view Audit Logs in Permit Dashboard

Navigate to the [Audit Log Screen](https://app.permit.io/audit-log) in the Dashboard.

_Audit Log example with 2 lines in which `oz@permit.io` asked to perform the actions `list` and `delete` on the resources `task` and `document` and was approved._

### How to see more details about each Authorization decision?

If you hover on the thumb up icon under the _decision_ column, you will see the reason the user is allowed or denied.
For example, in the image below, `oz@permit.io` is allowed to `list` the `task` because he has the `admin` role.
