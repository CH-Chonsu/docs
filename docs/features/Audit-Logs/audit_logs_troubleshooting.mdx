# Where are my Audit Logs?

There are several reasons that will prevent you from seeing logs

## Reason 1: Environemnt
The audit log displays audit logs for the selected **active environment**, so make sure that the relevant environment is selected.

Change environments in the [Project Management Screen](https://app.permit.io/project-management), simply click on the relevant **Set as active environment** button.

## Reason 2: App not connected
Make sure you have connected Permit SDK (or API) to your app.
* View the [onboarding demo](/tutorials/onboarding_demo) starting at 01:30.
* Navigate to [connect an SDK page](https://app.permit.io/get-started/connect-an-sdk) for written instructions.
<!-- * Can't find your language SDK? See what [other languages](/reference/SDKs/Other/other_instructions) should do. -->

* You can open http://localhost:4000/ to make sure that your test app is running

## Reason 3: Permit isn't running
One of the reasons that logs will not appear in the audit log screen is that Permit is not running in the background.

In these cases, you will see that your user is not permitted to perform actions regardless of the user's roles and permissions.

To fix this issue, follow the instructions on how to run Permit available on the [connect an SDK page](https://app.permit.io/get-started/connect-an-sdk).

## Reason 4: Filters prevent from logs to appear

If you applied a filter on the audit log page, your audits might not appear.

To remove the filters, simply refresh the audit log page.
