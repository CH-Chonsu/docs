# Modeling Google Drive Permissions with ReBAC

This tutorial explains how to build a simplified [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/) permission system using [Permit.io](https://permit.io).

:::info Early Access Feature
**ReBAC** (relationship based access control) is now in early access. &nbsp; **[Contact us](https://bit.ly/permit-slack)** to try it out.
:::

## Before you start

1. [Sign up to Permit.io](tutorials/onboarding/lets-begin.mdx)
2. [Get your environment API Key](tutorials/quickstart.mdx)

## The Google Drive Model

### Overview

Google drive is a system you can use to store, share, and collaborate on files and folders.

The G-Drive permission model is [documented here](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/guides/ref-roles).
For simplicity we will implement a subset of it with Permit.

Our requirements:

1. **Object Hierarchy:** A google drive account can contain many folders and files. Folders can contain other files and folders.
2. **Direct file access:** A user can be a viewer of file, a commenter (meaning he can view and comment on the contents) or an editor (can view, comment and edit).
3. **Folder-level access:** A user can be granted access to a folder. A user access level on a certain folder will grant that same access level on all the files within the folder.
4. **Account admin access:** A user can be granted admin access to the entire account, which will grant the highest permission level on all folders and files within the account.
5. **General access to "Everyone in account":** Files can be shared with all the users who are associated with the account that contains the file (share with all account members).

### Schema objects

Before we can start implementing the model, let's describe the different types of Permit API objects we will work with.

#### Resources

**Resources** in Permit are objects that you can enforce permissions on. Each resource has a predefined set of actions that a user can perform on said resource.

When we refer to resources we typically refer to types and not to specific instances of that resource.

Permit ReBAC allows you to model your resources as a graph.
Each resource (a type) is a node in the graph, and can connect to other resources via edges called relations.

The resources we will define for this example are:

```
- Account
- Folder
- File
```

#### Resource Relations

A **relation** is a type of an edge in the graph between two resources.

A relation called `parent` between a `File` resource and a `Folder` creates the ability to define this type of relationship between two resource instances of these types, for example:

```
(Folder:soc2, parent, File:access-control-policy)
```

The relations we will define are:

```js
Folder.account -> Account // relation from folder to its parent account
File.account -> Account // relation from file to its parent account
Folder.parent -> Folder // relation from folder to its parent folder (optional)
File.parent -> Folder // relation from file to its parent folder (optional)
```

#### Resource Roles

Each resource type can define its own roles. A **resource role** represents an access level (or a set of permissions) that can be granted on instances of a specific resource type.

Resource roles are typically denoted like this: `Folder#editor`. The notation means: a resource role with key `editor` that is defined on the resource type with key `Folder`.

The resource roles we will define are:

```
- Account#admin
- Account#member

- Folder#editor
- Folder#commenter
- Folder#viewer

- File#editor
- File#commenter
- File#viewer
```

#### The model so far

In this diagram:

- **Resources** are denoted by black circles
- **Resource Roles** are denoted by blue circles
- **Resource Relations** are denoted by black edges (or arrows)

### Data objects

#### Resource Instances

A resource instance is a specific object whos type is defined by a resource (type).

For example: `Folder:soc2` is a resource instance whos type is the resource `Folder` and instance key is `soc2`.
Each instance is denoted `type:instance` where `type` is the key of the resource (type) and `instance` is the key of the resource instance.

You cannot have two resource instances with the same type and the same key, `Folder:soc2` is unique under your environment.

**Users** and **Tenants** in permit are first-class objects who are infact instances belonging to the `User` and `Tenant` built-in resource types respectively.

#### Relationships

A relationship is a system fact that describs a connection (a directed edge in the graph) between a subject, relation and object.

A relationship will always specifies the subject first, the relation second and the object third: `(subject, relation, object)`

Examples:

```
(Folder:soc2, parent, File:access-control-policy)
(Folder:rnd, parent, File:system-architecture)
(Account:permitio, parent, File:rnd)
```

#### Role Assignments

Role assignments are special type of relationship where:

- the subject is a user
- the relation is a role
- the object is a resource instance

Examples:

```
(john@company.com, viewer, File:system-architecture)
```

### Test scenarios

...

## Implementing with Permit

### 1. Direct access to files

internal vs external user

### 2. Permissions on Folders

### 3. Folder Permissions grant file permissions

### 4. Account admin permissions

### 5. General access to "Everyone in account"
