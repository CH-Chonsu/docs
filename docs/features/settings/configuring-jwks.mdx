# Configure your obtained JWKs in Permit
Some features in Permit.io like - Permit Elements and FoAz (Front-end Only Authorization) require you to configure your JWKs (JSON Web Keys) in the Settings section.

Setting the JWKs is a one time process and you don't need to do it again for the same environment.

## Why do I need to configure JWKs?
Permit uses JWKs to verify the JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) that are generated by your backend. The JWKs are used to verify the signature of the JWTs and ensure that the JWTs are not tampered with.
Usually, features that are interacting with your end-users, and specifically your Frontend, will need to use the JWKs to verify the JWTs and to make secured API calls to your backend.

## How do I obtain my JWKs?

Usually JWKs can be found in a file called `jwks.json` in your Authentication provider and it is publicly accessible.
If you are using a third party service to generate your JWTs, you can find the JWKs in the settings section of the service.
Read more about fetching your application's JWKs [in our docs](/docs/foaz/fetching-jwks).

The object you paste in should look something like the example below, where `kid` is the unique identifier for the JWK.

```json
"jwks": {
        "keys": [
            {
                "alg": "RS256",
                "kty": "RSA",
                "use": "sig",
                "n": "****",
                "e": "****",
                "kid": "****",
                "x5t": "****",
                "x5c": [
                    "****"
                ]
            }
        ]
    },
