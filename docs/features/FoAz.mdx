## What is Frontend-Only-Authorization ?

Frontend-only-Authorization (FoAz) is a method allowing frontend applications to enforce protected access to APIs without requiring a dedicated backend.
FoAz allows frontend developers to securely use sensitive resources directly from the frontend, while gating for permissions and without exposing any secrets or sensitive data.

## Isn't Frontend Authorization an Oxymoron ?

It sure sounds like it, but no - it works, it's easy, and it's super safe.

The "trick" is that it's frontend-only in the same sense that Serverless has no servers.
There is a backend component which actually enforces the access, you just don't have to build it Permit.io provides it for you - so you can focus on building your awesome app.

## What is FoAz Good for ?

Foremost FoAz is about rapid secure app development; specifically there are two core use cases.

- ### Access 3rd Party Services

  ```mermaid
  flowchart LR
      Frontend --protected API call--> proxy.Permit.io
      proxy.Permit.io --"permit.check() + inject secrets"--> p["Protected Service (e.g. Twilio)"]
      p --response-->proxy.Permit.io
      proxy.Permit.io --response-->Frontend
  ```

  Web applications often consume external services to implement their features; for example an app might use Twilio to send an invite via SMS, Stripe to bill the user, or Mailchimp to notify them of user activities.
  All of these would require a secret or API toke; coupled with the App developers account, and would often cost money to use.

  Without FoAz a developer would have to deploy a backend service to accept the frontend requests, verify the session identity, check for permissions, and invoke the external API along with it's associated secret.
  With FoAz a developer can simply call the external service directly from the frontend, knowing that Permit will verify the identity, check for permissions, and add the needed secrets for them.

- ### Adding Authorization on top of Your API

  ```mermaid
  flowchart LR
      Frontend --protected API call--> proxy.Permit.io
      proxy.Permit.io --"permit.check()"--> p["Your app [secret route]"]
      p --response-->proxy.Permit.io
      proxy.Permit.io --response-->Frontend
  ```

  Be it legacy code, new code, or an app still being developed, your homebrew authorization probably doesn't meet the standard you need from it.
  While we'd always encourage you to deploy Permit as part of your backend to make your application's authorization truly future-proof, we understand the importance of RND velocity.

  FoAz can be used to wrap and protect your API, adding more complex policies (e.g. RBAC, ABAC, ReBAC) and access-control interfaces (e.g. audit-logs, user-management), without having to change a single line of backend code.

  :::info
  To use this securely you still need to add a secret between Permit and your API,
  but this can even be just a separate route (e.g. `your-api.com/permit-secret-guid/resource`), or gated by a API-gateway or reverse-proxy.
  :::

## How does FoAz Work?

FoAz uses Permit.io as the backend component to check and enforce access to the protected API or resource.
Permit.io acts as a proxy between your frontend, and the end resource - adding JWT verification, permission checks, and injecting the end target secrets.

Arguably FoAz is actually more secure than a proprietary backend you'd build from scratch; as it ensures policies are always in place; and audit logs are automatically generated.

### Communication Sequence Diagram

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Your Frontend ->> Authentication Provider: login
    Authentication Provider -->> Your Frontend: JWT
    Your Frontend->> Permit.io: Login with Permit (JWT for JWT)
    Permit.io -->> Your Frontend : Permit.io JWT
    Your Frontend->> Permit.io: Protected API call
    alt allowed
        Permit.io ->> Secret Vault : load secrets into protected call
        Permit.io ->> Protected Service : actual API call
        Protected Service -->> Permit.io: response
        Permit.io -->> Your Frontend : response
    else denied
        Permit.io -->> Your Frontend : 403
    end
```

## How do I use FoAz ?

:::info
Note: interfaces here are in early in access and are likely to change.
:::

1. ### Setup

   1. Configure your JWKS with Permit, so it will be able to verify your user JWTs for you.
   2. Configure the Protected API call with Permit, and set a secret for it. This makes sure Permit will only call APIs you defined.
   3. Map the API call to a resource / action, so you can use the policy-editor to define permissions for it. This makes sure Permit will only call API when you allow them.

2. ### Login

   Login your frontend user with Permit.
   Permit.io's Frontend SDK provides a [login method](/features/permit-elements/element/user-management#client-side-login-method) to which you pass your user's JWT.

3. ### Call API via Permit

   After the login, we can now invoke the Permit SDK with an [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) like interface.

   See an example below using Twilio with basic HTTP authentication (note: Bearer Token, and Cookie authentication are similarly supported.):

   ```javascript
   // Send an SMS with Twilio via a Permit FoAz protected API call
   // `{{}}` used to template and render secrets into the call at the secure proxy
   permit.proxy.post(
        'https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/{{accountSID}}/Messages.json?Body=hello&To=555&From=1337',
        // Templates to be loaded with actual secrets at proxy.permit.io prior to the actual call to Twilio
        auth: {
            username: "{{accountSID}}"
            password: "{{twilioAuthToken}}"
        }
   }).then((res) => {
        console.log(res, 'res');
   }).catch((err) => {
        console.log(err);
   });
   ```
