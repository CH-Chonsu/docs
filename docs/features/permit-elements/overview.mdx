# Permit Elements

<span className="subtitle-custom">

</span>

### <span className="text-xl">Embeddable UI Components</span>

**[Permit Elements](/features/permit-elements/element/user-management)** is a set of prebuilt UI components for implementing and abstracting your
Authorization needs. Giving users the flexibility to extract a specific part of the Permit UI functionality was
very important. Making sure that it's very easy to implement and use was a priority.

Elements features include:

<div className="list">
	<ul>
		<li>
			<span>
				High Security to meet industry-standard protocols and ensure user
				authorization processes are robust
			</span>
		</li>
