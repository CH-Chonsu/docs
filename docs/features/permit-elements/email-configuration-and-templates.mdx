### What are Email configuration and templates?

Permit.io Email Configuration and Templates allow you to seamlessly integrate Elements features into a selected Email provider.
This enables you to automatically send notifications and action controls to end users using your preferred email provider.
You can invite, approve, and engage with users efficiently, creating a streamlined workflow using smart and fully customizable emails.

### Setting up Email Configuration

#### 1. Turn on email notifications
The first step will be to turn on email notifications in the desired Element config.
This will allow you to configure your email provider and templates.
For example here, we are turning on email notifications for the **[User Management Element](/features/permit-elements/element/user-management)**.

![Turn on email notifications](/img/elements/emails/email-notification-toggle.png)

#### 2. Select your email provider
Next, you will need to select your email provider.

In the Element Settings Screen you will see a menu with the available email providers:

![Select your email provider](/img/elements/emails/elements-settings.png)

Select the provider you would like to use and fill in the required fields:

![Select your email provider](/img/elements/emails/email-providers.png)

Now you'll be able to send a test email to make sure everything is working correctly ‚úÖ:

#### 3. Customize your email templates
Now that you have your email provider set up, you can customize your email templates.
For example, when setting up the **[User Management Element](/features/permit-elements/element/user-management)** template, the end user that being invited will get a customized email.

After filling in the required fields, you can customize the email message using HTML and CSS:

![Customize your email templates](/img/elements/emails/email-template-content.png)


That's it üëè! You can now send automatic and customized emails to your end users using your preferred email provider.


### Templates Variables (Coming Soon)
In the upcoming weeks we will be adding more template variables to allow you to customize your emails even further.
For example:
<div className="list">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span>Setting your Email "Subject" to include the user full name </span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Custom query parameters to your "Redirect To" URL</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span>Make much more powerful Email message content using variables</span>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
