# Features - Coming Soon

There are so many experiences needed for common access-controls in products, and we are step by steps adding them all.
Below are a few of the features we are currently working on. Click the Up-vote / Like button to help us prioritize them.
You've seen these a billion times, across multiple products - this time you'll be able to add them in a snap.

## API key management

Access to your product shouldn't be limited to humans, add API-key management to your product with ease, to provide secure developer access.

## Impersonation

More often than not you need to see your application from, the eyes of your users (but of course not really logging in as one of them).
Impersonation provides an easy to use (and audit) "view as" capability.

## Permission Requests

Allow your users to request permissions to features, resources, or other assets they don't have access to.
Manage requests across the application in your back-office, and allow users to approve requests on their own.

## Approval flows

Access shouldn't be flat - protect critical paths with approval flows.
Require users to ask for additional approval from their team as part of a process (e.g. manager approving employee submissions).
