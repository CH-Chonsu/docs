# Audit Logs

Knowing who has done what in your application is critical for multiple reasons; including security, compliance, debugging, and even just plain old monitoring.
Audit logs are a great way to track who did what, when, and why.
They are a useful tool both for you and your team as the maintainers of your application, but also your end-users, who want to track their own usage and actions within the app.

## Automatic Generation

Thanks to the fact that Permit.io powers your application, you can automatically generate audit logs.
Enforcement points, along with resource and action definitions, and user/tenant configurations automatically come together to generate the full picture needed for an audit log entry.

## Types of Audit Logs

- Basic audit logs - these are the basic logs detailed above
- Decision Logs - more in depth logs reflecting "why" the policy engine made a decision
