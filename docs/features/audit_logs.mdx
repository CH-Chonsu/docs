# Audit Logs

Knowing who has done what in your application is critical for multiple reasons; including security, compliance, debugging, and even just plain old monitoring.
Audit logs are a great way to track who did what, when, and why.
They are a useful tool both for you and your team as the maintainers of your application, but also your end-users, who want to track their own usage and actions within the app.

## Automatic Generation

Thanks to the fact that Permit.io powers your application, you can automatically generate audit logs.
Enforcement points, along with resource and action definitions, and user/tenant configurations automatically come together to generate the full picture needed for an audit log entry.

## Types of Audit Logs

- Basic audit logs - these are the basic logs detailed above
- Decision Logs - more in depth logs reflecting "why" the policy engine made a decision

## How to view Audit Logs in Permit Dashboard

Go to the [Audit Log Screen](https://app.permit.io/audit-log) in the Permit.io Dashboard.

### How to see more details about each Authorization decision?

If you hover on the thumb up icon under the _decision_ column, you will see the reason the user is allowed or denied.
For example, in the image below, `oz@permit.io` is allowed to `list` the `task` because he has the `admin` role.

### What if I don't see any logs?

- The audit log screen will only show audit logs for the **active environment**.
  You may select a different environment in the [Project Management Screen](https://app.permit.io/project-management), simply click on the **Set as active environment** button next to the desired environment.
- If you selected your desired environment and still don't see any audit logs, make sure you have correctly connected the SDK to your app, as shown in the onboarding wizard.

### How to filter specific logs?

If you click on the **Filter entries** box, you can filter logs based on user, decision or resource:

You may also filter according to **time**. To filter by time you can use the date filter box on the left and choose the desired time span:

In the example below you can see that we filtered all the `denied` decisions on the `board` resource made in the last month:
