title: ABAC Design Patterns
---

Below you'd find common authorization design-patterns implemented in ABAC, and guides on how to implement them.

## Ownership

Ownership is one of the more common authorization patterns - in which a user can perform actions only on resources they own.
There are three easy ways (in addition to writing policy directly as code) to implement ownership in Permit.io - all are equally valid and it's mostly a matter of taste.

- ### Ownership via tenants

  Ownership is defined by having the user and resource belong to the same tenant.
  While implemented as an ABAC policy behind the scenes - you don't need to actually do so yourself - and you can enjoy the simplified API which treats tenants as a first class citizen.

  [Read here](/features/multitenancy) on creating and checking permissions based on tenancy.

- ### Ownership via list on resource

  The resource has an attribute listing all the user ids that own it.
  Use a [resource-set](/features/policy-editor/abac/building-abac-policy#define-a-resource-set) to check against the list.

  It would look something like this:

  <img src="/img/resource_ownership.jpg" style={{ maxHeight: "45vh" }} />

  And the permission check (assuming loading the attribute as part of the check) would look something like this:

  ```javascript
  const permitted = await permit.check(userKey, "read", {
    type: "file", // The resource name
    attributes: {
      owners: [
        "d08c85a349994aeb89a3f02c08bdb340", // user-1
        "48fb889360604253a5189580b48694cf", // user-2
      ],
    },
  });
  ```

- ### Ownership via list on user profile
  The user profile has an attribute listing all the resource ids that it owns.
  Use a [user-set](/features/policy-editor/abac/building-abac-policy#define-a-user-set) to check against the list.

## Belonging to a group

Groups are a classic ReBAC concept; but ReBAC is a subset of ABAC, and we can often use it to implement group affiliation.
The group can be represented as a resource by itself, a tenant, or an attribute of users or resources.

- ### Group by tenants

  You can use tenants as groups - having several tenants together form the actual higher level tenant.
  Those can then be grouped by [tenant attributes](/features/policy-editor/abac/defining-attributes#define-stored-tenant-attributes).

- ### Group by attributes
  You can assign users and resources to a group using an attribute like `group_id` or `group_name` -
  Implementation here is very similar to the ownership design pattern.

:::info
Once we add ReBAC and groups natively to Permit.io - those would be the default recommended way to implement groups.
