# Role-Based Access Control

## What is RBAC?

**Role-based Access Control** is an authorization model that focuses on **assigning permissions to users based on their role** within
an organization. It's the most basic and simple approach to access management. RBAC allows us to analyze the needs of particular users
and group them into roles based on common responsibilities. You can then assign one or more roles to each user, and many actions to each
role, where each action can or cannot be performed on a specific resource you have defined.

Let's have a look at a simple example of RBAC.

:::info Example
Within a HR Department, **only HR Managers** can **update employee details**, while **other employees** can **only view their details**.
