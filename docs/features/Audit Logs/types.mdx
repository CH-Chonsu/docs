# Audit Logs

Knowing who has done what in your application is critical for multiple reasons, including security, compliance, 
debugging and even just plain old monitoring. **[Audit Logs](https://app.permit.io/audit-log)** are a great way 
to track **who did what**, **when they did it**, **why they had permissions** and/or **did not have permissions** to do so!

They are a useful tool both for you and your team as the maintainers of your application, but also your end-users, 
who want to track their own usage and actions within the app.

## Automatic Generation

As Permit.io powers your application, you are getting **automatic audit logs**.

Enforcement points, along with resource and action definitions, and user/tenant configurations automatically come together 
to generate the full picture needed for an audit log entry.

While our Permit web interface provides a dedicated page for viewing your audit logs, you can also **find them directly**
in your deployed PDP microservice.

## Types of Audit Logs

There are two types of audit logs:
- **Basic audit logs** - these are the basic logs reflecting actions in regards to your policiy rules.
- **Decision logs** - more in-depth logs reflecting "**why**" the policy engine made a decision.

## View Audit Logs

Navigate to the **[Audit Log](https://app.permit.io/audit-log)** page in the Permit dashboard.

_Above is an Audit Log example with 2 lines in which `oz@permit.io` asked to perform the actions `list` and `delete` on the resources `task` and `document`, following approval._

### How to see more details about each Authorization decision?

If you hover on the thumbs up icon under the ***decision*** column, you will see the reason the user is allowed or denied.

:::info
In the image below, `oz@permit.io` is allowed to `list` the `task` because he has the `admin` role.
