title: Integrating Permit with Authentication Providers
---

As part of the whole IAM flow, as well as Authorization, Authentication too plays an important role in the process.

:::info
**Permit integrates flawlessly into any Authentication provider** as long as they can issue a **JWT (JSON Web Token)**.
Most providers make use of this standard for **encrypting user information**.
:::

While using any Authentication provider and the JWT they provide, you are able to **extract the unique ID of the current user**, along
with other information like their email and name - and **easily sync that information into Permit**, or check agains that unique ID.

:::tip
We provide the **SyncUser function** for all our **SDK's**.
:::

All of this process usually happends at the **handoff point**; or in other words a middleware function - making sure that both the AuthN and AuthZ
solutions are aware of the same user.
