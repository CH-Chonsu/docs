# Kong + Permit.io

To enforce access to APIs behind a Kong gateway using Permit.io follow the guide below.

# Connect your Kong Gateway to Permit.io

If you have Kong Gateway properly configured to relay requests from your users to your backend, you can easily use Permit.io to authorize requests as they go in, with a real time administration layer that has a nice user interface for everybody in your organization but is policy-as-code behind the scenes.

## Installing the PDP sidecar

As a first set lets setup Permit.io's PDP as a container next to the gateway and enable to Kong integration.
Pull our PDP container from Docker Hub [(Click here to install Docker)](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/):
Run the container:

```sh
docker run \
  -p 7766:7000 \
  --env PDP_API_KEY={{ client_secret }} \
  --env PDP_KONG_INTEGRATION=true \
  {{ docker_container_image }}
```

## Add the OPA plugin to Kong

Once the PDP container is running, you can configure your runtime instance to authorize requests through the PDP. In your Kong Route configuration, add a plugin:

![Add Kong OPA plugin](https://permit-instructions-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/instructions-kong-1.png)

In the plugin configuration, set the following values:

- "Config.include Consumer In Opa Input" - should be checked
- "Config.Opa Host" = The PDP's IP address
- "Config.Opa Path" = "/kong"
- "Config.Opa Port" = 7766
- "Config.Opa Protocol" = "http"

![Input the OPA plugin values to connect it to Kong](https://permit-instructions-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/instructions-kong-2.png)

By default, / will be mapped to the "index" resource, and other routes to the first element in their paths (so, for example, "/repo" will be mapped to the "repo" resource).

Finally, go to the route you configured to see the outcome of the permission check.
