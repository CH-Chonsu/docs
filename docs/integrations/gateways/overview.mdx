title: Proxies and Gateways Overview
---

Permit.io provides **multiple ways** to **set access-control enforcement points** in your software.

While the classic approach is to embed enforcement points in the code via the use of our SDK's;
per a specific line of code, a route, or inside a middleware - you can also easily use Permit to enforce access inside your code
**using reverse-proxies** - (e.g. Envoy, Traefik) - and **API Gateways** - (e.g. Kong, AWS API Gateway).

:::tip
Most of these integrations can easily be done using **OPA's plugin system** with **very little configuration**.
