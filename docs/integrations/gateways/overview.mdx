title: Proxies and Gateways Overview
---

Permit.io provides multiple ways to set access-control enforcement points in your software.

While the classic approach is to embed those in the code via the SDKS (per line of code, per route, per middleware etc.), you can as easily use Permit with external points to your code using reverse-proxies (e.g. Envoy, Traefik) and API Gateways (e.g. Kong, AWS API Gateway),

Most of these integrations can easily be done using OPA's plugin system and a little configuration.
