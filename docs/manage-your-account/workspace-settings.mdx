Managing your workspace efficiently is integral to optimizing your workflow and productivity. Within Permit, we provide
intuitive tools and features designed to help you seamlessly manage your team and their access, and maintain logs of all your
essential tasks.

## Member management

The team management tool ensures controlled access for team members. Depending on their roles, members might
modify policies through the dashboard or the API.

For workspace access control, navigate to the **Settings screen** and choose the **Members** tab.

### Understanding member roles

When adding a new member into your workspace, an invitation is sent to that user. As part of the invitation, you need to specify
whether the user will be assigned a `Workspace Owner` role or a `Workspace Editor` role.

- **Workspace Owner** can create new roles, resources and policies. They can change workspace settings and invite new members
  to the workspace.
- **Workspace Editor** can create new roles, resources and policies. They cannot invite or change access of other team members.

A user can have access to an entire workspace, or they can have access to individual projects and/or environments. If you want a member to have different
permissions for a particular project or environment, you can invite them directly into that specific project and environment with a
new role. Their workspace owner permissions will continue to remain unchanged elsewhere.

If you don't invite a user into your workspace as a member, but only invite them directly into a specific project or environment,
they would only be part of those projects, and their access level will be `Mixed`, if its more than two projects with different access.

#### Let's look at an example

Shaul, one of our talented engineers, has selective access within our workspace. While he has comprehensive access to the `Shopping 
App` project as its `Project Owner`, encompassing all its environments, his privileges are more limited in the `Internal App` project,
where he's an `Environment Editor` for just the `dev` environment.

### Adding new members

You can either invite members individually or send bulk invitations to your workspace. However, currently, we can't send bulk
invites with varied roles. If you want some users to be workspace owners and others to be workspace editors, you'll need to
handle this in two separate steps.

### Changing member roles

You can change the roles for each member, and for each project and environment they are assigned to, directly from the **Members** page.
If a user is part of more than two projects, but not of the workspace, you can also give him access to the entire workspace,
selecting either the `Workspace Editor` or `Workspace Owner` role.

### Removing a member

### Sending an invitation link

By default, when you invite a new member to your workspace, they will be sent an email with a link to accept the invitation. While
the invite is still pending, meaning the user has not yet accepted the invite, they will be shown as a blank user.

If for some reason the user has not received the email, you can manually copy the invitation link and send it directly to the user.
Each link is bespoke to every added user.
