## AuthZ Made Easy

We at the Permit.io team have been building software for decades,
and we got tired of constantly rebuilding and access-control.
Permissions, authorization, and access-control are not really unique to any product -
they should be plug&amp;play and should be easily upgradeable without having to change your code.
That's exactly what we've built for you at Permit.io

## What is Permit.io?

Permit.io is the permissions infrastructure for the internet.
A fullstack authorization solution enabling developers to bake-in access-control into their products
in minutes and have them ready for future demands from customers and regulation.

Our developer SDK integrates with your app and enables you to add declarative permission
checks that are as easy as using feature flags.

Our solution is built upon strong open source foundations, enables Git-Ops out of the box,
and goes far beyond enforcement - providing seamless access control **experiences** meant
for humans that simply work out-of-the-box: User Management, API Key management, Audit, User impersonation and so on.
