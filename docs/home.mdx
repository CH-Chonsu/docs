## Permit.io - AuthZ Made Easy

We at the Permit.io team have been building software for decades, working in dozens of companies of all sizes.  
We had one thing in common in all of these companies: we wrote, refactored, and debugged the same access-control code.

While access-control, permissions, and authorization requests are core to the product, they are also not unique to a specific product!  
This is a good thing: they share the same core principles and are being written over and over for no good reason.  
We always wanted it to be plug&amp;play and easily upgradeable without changing our code.  
That's what we've built for you at Permit.io - the permissions infrastructure for the internet.

## What is Permit.io?

Permit.io is the permissions infrastructure for the internet.
A fullstack authorization solution enabling developers to bake-in access-control into their products
within minutes and have them ready for future demands from customers and regulation.

Our developer SDK integrates with your app and enables you to add declarative permission
checks that are as easy to use as feature flags.

Our solution is built upon strong open source foundations, enables Git-Ops out of the box,
and goes far beyond enforcement - providing seamless access control **experiences** meant
for humans that simply work out-of-the-box: User Management, API Key management, Audit, User impersonation and so on.
