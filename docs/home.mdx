Welcome to Permit.io docs. Here you'll find comprehensive guides and resources to help you get started with Permit and explore our platform.

Permit.io is a fullstack, plug-and-play application-level authorization solution.
We enable you to implement a secure, flexible, authorization layer within minutes, so you can focus on what matters most -
**building your application!**

## Here's where we come in

We provide you with an easy-to-use, fully customizable, no-code Policy Editor, which empowers you and your entire team to securely manage
permissions - **no coding knowledge required**.

Permit generates fully transparent **[Policy as Code](/overview/how-does-it-work#decoupling-policy-and-code)** that you can manage through
**Git**, **APIs**, or our no-code UI.
