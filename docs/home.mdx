# Permit.io Docs

<!-- ## What is Permit.io?

Permit.io is a developer SDK that empowers developers to integrate permissions and access control into their product in minutes. Permit.io offers both enforcement APIs to check permissions, a backoffice to manage access to trusted resources, and also embedded UI interfaces that allows you to integrate complete UI experiences into the product in minutes. TBD to rewrite. -->
