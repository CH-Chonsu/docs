To enforce permissions, you must first create resources and define actions that can be performed on those resources.

Then, you can create roles and assign them permissions for every resource/action combination. These roles can then be assigned to users.

For example: You can have the resource `document` and the action `create` for it.
We can give permission to an `editor` role to `create a document`, and we can assign the `editor` role to a user named `Bob`.

This function helps you sync your resources and actions with Permit:

```js

const resourcesTypes : ResourcesTypes = {
  resources: [
    {
      type: "task",
      actions: {
        list: {},
        retrieve: {},
        create: {},
        update: {},
        delete: {},
      },
    },
    {
      type: "board",
      actions: {
        list: {},
        create: {},
        update: {},
        delete: {},
      },
    },
  ],
}

permit.syncResources(resourcesTypes);


// SyncResources returns ResourceStub[] type
// {
//     "url": string,
//     "data": [
//         {
//         "type": string,
//         "description": string,
//         "attributes": { },
//         "name": string,
//         "path": string,
//         "id": string,
//         "actions": [],
//         "isBuiltIn": false
//         }
//     ]
// }

```
