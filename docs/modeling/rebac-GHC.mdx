## Modeling Health Record Policies with ReBAC

The [Galactic-Health-Corporation](https://github.com/permitio/Galactic-Health-Corporation) app demonstrates various policy modeling capabilities within Permit.io ; but with the greatest emphasis on ReBAC modeling.
ReBAC is used to assign users roles to their own records, and selectively assign other users a caregiver role on all or some of the records of other users.
The app demonstrates dynamic use of the ReBAC API and UI combined with different combinations of role derivation.
Read the [app's repository Readme](https://github.com/permitio/Galactic-Health-Corporation) to get started.
