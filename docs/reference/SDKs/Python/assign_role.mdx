```python

permit.write(permit.api.assign_role(user.customId, Role.key, Tenant.key))

# returns the assigned role with RoleAssignment type
# {
#     id: string,
#     role: {
#         id: string,
#         name: string,
#         description: string,
#         tenantId: string,
#     },
#     user: string,
