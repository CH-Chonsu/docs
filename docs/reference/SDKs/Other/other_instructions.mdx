If you can't find an SDK suitable for your programming language, you have other options:

## Use our API

We provide a full API, you can check it out [here](/reference/api_reference)

## Auto Generate an SDK wrapper from our API

The fastest way for you to have an SDK supported for your language is to auto generate it.

Once we will release a formal SDK, you can simply replace your auto generated SDK with ours.

TBD add explanation / video how to do it.

## Permit.io Support and Help
