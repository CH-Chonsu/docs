```csharp
UserKey userObj = new UserKey(user.id, user.first_name, user.last_name, user.email);
permit.Api.SyncUser(userObj);
```

This function is used to sync (save) a user's information to the Permit.io cloud (and PDP) upon user creation.

The function should be used for the initial creation of the user; 

once the user is synced with Permit, you shouldn't use this API call anymore to update the user's data. 

Instead use: 

[Assign role](reference/SDKs/Dotnet/assign_role) SDK function to update user roles.

Or you can use Permit web application [user management](https://app.permit.io/user-management) or [policy editor](https://app.permit.io/policy-editor) to update user data.

You can also use the [rest API](https://api.permit.io/redoc).
