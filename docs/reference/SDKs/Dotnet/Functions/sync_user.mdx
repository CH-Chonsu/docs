```csharp
UserKey userObj = new UserKey(user.id, user.first_name, user.last_name, user.email);
permit.Api.SyncUser(userObj);
```

This function is used to sync a user's data with the Permit.io PDP on user creation.
Once user synced with Permit, you shouldn't use this API call anymore to update the user's data.
