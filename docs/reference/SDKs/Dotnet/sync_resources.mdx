To enforce permissions you need to create resources and actions that can be performed on those resources.
Than you create roles that can perform some of those actions and assign those roles to users.

This function helps you sync your resources and actions with Permit.

```csharp
string resourceName = "document";
string actionName = "create";
// define the action title and description (can be empty)
ActionProperties actionProperties = new ActionProperties(
    "Create document",
    "Ability to create document"
);
// define the actions
Dictionary<string, ActionProperties> resourceActions = new Dictionary<string, ActionProperties>{{ actionName, actionProperties }};
// define the resource with it's actions
ResourceType[] resourcesToSync = { new ResourceType(resourceName, resourceActions) };
// sync the resources to Permit
var syncedResources = await permitClient.Api.SyncResources(resourcesToSync);
```
