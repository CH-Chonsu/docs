To enforce permissions you first need to create resources; and define actions that can be performed on those resources.

Then you can create roles and assign them permissions for every resource/action combination; these roles can then be assigned to users.

For example: You can have the resource `document` and the action `create` for it.
Then we can give permission to an `editor` role to `create a document`, and we can assign the `editor` role to a user named `Bob`.

This function helps you sync your resources and actions with Permit.

```csharp
string resourceName = "document";
string actionName = "create";
// define the action title and description (can be empty)
ActionProperties actionProperties = new ActionProperties(
    "Create document",
    "Ability to create document"
);
// define the action
Dictionary<string, ActionProperties> resourceActions = new Dictionary<string, ActionProperties>{{ actionName, actionProperties }};
// define the resource with its actions
ResourceType[] resourcesToSync = { new ResourceType(resourceName, resourceActions) };
// sync the resources to Permit
var syncedResources = await permitClient.Api.SyncResources(resourcesToSync);

// SyncResources returns true if the resource was synced otherwise false


```
