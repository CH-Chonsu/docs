## Integrate your own application

To integrate your own application, you can use the Permit SDK in your own code.
Lets say that you have a web app that uses the Permit SDK to check for permissions.
For each user that sign in, you have unique identifier for example a user_id / email / Auth0Id / CognitoId / etc.
Your user object prboably looks something like this (Example from Auth0):

#### Example user object

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "abc123livrjeoigv",
    "tenant": "my-tenant",
    "username": "user1",
    "password": "xxxxxxx",
    "email": "user1@foo.com",
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "emailVerified": true,
  }
}
```

#### Sync user
This SDK function is used to sync a user's data with the Permit.io PDP on user creation.
Once user synced with Permit, you shouldn't use this API call anymore to update the user's data.

```csharp
UserKey userObj = new UserKey(user.id, user.first_name, user.last_name, user.email);
permit.Api.SyncUser(userObj);
```
#### Assign user
To update user role after user has been synced/created, you can use the following function:

```csharp
assignedRole = await permit.Api.AssignRole(user.customId, Role.id, Tenant.externalId);
```

#### List roles
To get the available roles, you can use the following function:

```csharp
Role[] roles = await permit.Api.GetRoles();
```

#### Manage resoruces
To sync your resources and actions you can use our [web application](https://permit.io/app/policy-editor). 
Or you can use [SyncResources](/reference/SDKs/Dotnet/Functions/sync_resources) SDK function.

#### List tenants
To get the available tenants, you can use the following [api call](/reference/api_with_cli#get-all-tenants)
