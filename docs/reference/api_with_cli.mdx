# Use api

You can manage most of Permit functionality from the [web application](https://app.permit.io/).

That being said, you may want to use the API from time to time.

You can do it with Postman or any other REST client as well as with CLI tools like curl.

## Postman

You can downdload the [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/mac) and use it to test the API.

API docs are available at [https://api.permit.io/redoc](https://api.permit.io/redoc)


## CURL

You can use the [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) command line tool to use or test the API.
You will need to get the ACCESS_TOKEN from the web application.

Go to [https://app.permit.io/](https://app.permit.io/) and click on the **Login** button.
Then open [the **Developer Tools** menu](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open/) and click on the **Network** tab.
There you can filter for **api.permit.io** requests and take the token from the authorization header as seen in the picture below.

![Get Bearer token Screenshot](/img/screenshots/get_bearer_token.png)
_The Authorization header is marked, you will see it in the requests for api.permit.io_

Then you can replace the ACCESS_TOKEN with the one you got from the web application.

### Get all users

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" https://api.permit.io/v1/users
```
