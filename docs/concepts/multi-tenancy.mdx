title: Multi-Tenancy
---

Most modern applications, especially microservices-based ones, require some degree of multi-tenancy.

There are advantages of using multi-tenancy:

- Allows a **secure and compliant** access separation.
- Allows the application to **serve multiple customers** at once - while sharing the underlying infrastructure and services.
- Allows for **load balancing** and **scaling**.

An authorization layer is the most robust and fastest way to **upgrade** from a single-tenant application to a multi-tenant 
application **safely**. By applying a policy across all the relevant services, the authorization layer can apply the needed 
separation without requiring changes to the services themselves.
