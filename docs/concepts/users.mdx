# Users

Users can represent both people and automated entities.
Users are assigned to tenants (each user can belong to more than one tenant) and can then be assigned roles and permissions. The user's granted roles and permissions will decide what actions in your app will be allowed or denied for that user.

# User Management

Users can be created, updated, and deleted through the user-management interface (available through the back-offices main sidebar menu).
