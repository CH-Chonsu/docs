# Users

Users can represent both people and automated entities.
Users are assigned to tenants (each can belong to more than one) and can be assigned roles and attributes which will power decision making in their regard as they use your products and are authorized (or denied) access.

# User Management

Users can be created, updated, and deleted, through the user-management interface (available through the back-offices main sidebar menu).
