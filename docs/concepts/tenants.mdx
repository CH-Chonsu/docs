# Tenants

A tenant is a group of users that share a common organizational identity.
Usually, each tenant will represent one of the end-customer companies in your product (i.e. the company that you sell to).
Through the tenant feature we enable you to have multi-tenancy straight out of the box.

## Single Tenant Mode

You can pass a tenant identifier for every `permit.check()` call you perform,
but for cases where you have a single tenant, you can use the `tenant` parameter in the SDK `init()` to specify the tenant to be used as a default.
This can also be useful in multi-tenancy scenarios, where you have a default global organization people belong to.

# Users
