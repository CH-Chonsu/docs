# Projects and Environments

Projects are the highest level of encapsulation for your authorization. Every unique service or application that requires its own set of policies and roles is a project.
In addition each project can support multiple environments - allowing for different policies for different deployments or configurations - such as Production, Dev, or Staging.

## Projects tab

You can create and switch between projects through the project tab selected from the [back-office's](https://app.permit.io) sidebar.

## Project Keys

Each project has a unique key that is used to identify it in the system.
You link a service, application, or code to a project by using the project key in the SDK init call.
