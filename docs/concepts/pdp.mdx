# PDP (Policy Decision Point)

A PDP is a network node in an application that provides an endpoint to test for policy decisions- i.e. services may ask the PDP if specific actions or requests are allowed according to the set policy.

PDPs need to be highly available, performant and physically close to the querying services to avoid latency.

The most straightforward way to integrate PDPs into a microservices architecture is as sidecars - meaning each microservice has a sidecar container next to it which it can query for policy.
Other topologies include centralized PDP, gateway to PDP (i.e. filtering requests at API gateways or proxies).

Permit.io supports all PDP layouts and provides the missing layers on-top of open-source PDP solutions (such as OpenPolicyAgent). These layers include policy delivery and updating, supporting data collection, application level SDKs, application level instrumentation and more.
