# PDP (Policy Decision Point)

A PDP is a network node in an application that provides an endpoint to test for policy decisions- i.e. services may ask the PDP if specific actions or requests are allowed according to the set policy.

PDPs need to be highly available, performant and physically close to the querying services to avoid latency.

The most straightforward way to integrate PDPs into a microservices architecture is as sidecars - meaning each microservice has a sidecar container next to it which it can query for policy.
Other topologies include centralized PDP, gateway to PDP (i.e. filtering requests at API gateways or proxies).

Permit.io supports all PDP layouts and provides the missing layers on-top of open-source PDP solutions (such as OpenPolicyAgent). These layers include policy delivery and updating, supporting data collection, application level SDKs, application level instrumentation and more.

## Powered by OPA+OPAL

Permit.io's PDP orchestration is powered by [OPAL](https://opal.ac) - an open source project - developed by the team at Permit.io and supported by a large community of developers and users.
Check out this talk with the primary authors of OPAL to learn more about the unique realtime architecture:

OPAL's built-in [separation of the data plane from the control plane](/concepts/control_plane_and_data_plane.mdx), enables Permit.io users to enjoy the benefits of a fully distributed PDP solution, without having to be dependant on the availability of the Permit.io cloud, or sharing any data with it.
