# Overview

The PDP container is built to support your product's scale and needs.

Let's take a look at it:

![Permit data model](/img/screenshots/hierarchy-overview.png)

## Workspace

The first hierarchy level is your workspace, which you defined in the onboarding.

## Project

Within your organization, you can have multiple projects. 
Each project represent each of your offerings, where an offering can be a different product, software, tool. 
By default, we defined “default organization” for you.

Manage projects from the [project management screen](https://app.permit.io/project-management).

:::note
If you have one product line, you can ignore this level of hierarchy.

## Environment

Within your project, you create environments, i.e. dev, staging, production, etc. 
Every environment has a secret key that you use to permform permissions checks through permit’s SDK and APIs.

Manage environments from the [project management screen](https://app.permit.io/project-management).

## Policy

A policy consist of users, actions, and resources.
A policy resides in an environemnt.

Manage policies from the [policy editor page](https://app.permit.io/policy-editor).

### Tenatns

A tenant is a group of users that share a common organizational identity. 
Usually, each tenant will represent one of the end-customer companies (i.e. the company that you sell to).
Read more about tenants [here](/concepts/tenants).

Manage tenants from the [users management screen](https://app.permit.io/user-management).

### Roles

Roles exist on an organization level - wether you change project, tenant, environment, the same roles exist for you.

Manage roles as part of the [policy editor page](https://app.permit.io/policy-editor).
