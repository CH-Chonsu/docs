Welcome to Permit! In this quick tutorial, we will go over the basic steps of setting up your account with Permit and creating
a very basic authorization policy. Let‚Äôs get started!

## 1. Create a Permit account

The first step is creating an account. This account will be used to configure and manage the authorization layer of your application.

:::note Social Logins and SSO
You can log into Permit with your Google / GitHub account.
Permit also offers Single Sign-On (SSO) login functionality, allowing users to access their accounts using enterprise credentials.
SSO is provided as the default option in [Permit‚Äôs Enterprise Tier](http://permit.io/pricing), or as a standalone option at a yearly
defined rate.

To get a custom quote on SSO, reach out to us via our **[Slack Community](https://io.permit.io/docs-to-slack)**.

## 2. Creating a workspace

First, you will need to create your workspace (Or, organizational account), under which all of your configurations,
projects, and environments reside. This will often correspond with your company‚Äôs name.

:::tip Example:
We have a pizzeria called "Johns Pizza" - this is our business, so that's what we will call our organization
:::

:::note
You can have multiple workspaces and switch between them - although usually, you'd only need one. Workspaces are completely
siloed from one another.
:::

## 3. Define your first policy

A basic [authorization policy](/overview/glossary#policy) consists of three elements: a **Resource**, an **Action**, and a **Role**.

- Start by defining a **resource** - this is going to be the entity which you want to manage access for.

:::tip Example:
John's Pizza has a **Kitchen**, that only certain individuals have access to, and can only perform restricted actions in.
Our resource is the Kitchen
:::

![Resource](/ui-videos/getting-started/quickstart/2.png)

- Then, define the possible actions in regard to the defined resource.

:::tip Example:
The Kitchen will have three actions applied - **Enter**, **Cook**, and **Manage**
:::

![Actions](/ui-videos/getting-started/quickstart/3.png)

- Now that we have a resource and actions defined, let‚Äôs add roles into the mix.

:::tip Example:
A **Chef** - Can **Enter**, **Cook**, and **Manage** the Kitchen.
A Manager - Can **Enter** and **Manage** the kitchen, but not **Cook**.
A Waiter - Can only **Enter** the Kitchen.
:::

- Using the UI, assign the relevant policies accordingly. Note that policy assignment can also be done via our API.

![Assingment](/ui-videos/getting-started/quickstart/0.png)

- With our new policy defined, we can assign the roles we created to actual users. Under ‚ÄúEmail‚Äù,
  fill in the actual users to which you want to assign these roles.

:::note
Filling the emails of your actual users in this section is optional - in an actual application,
users will usually be identified by GUIDs and not their actual data.
:::

That‚Äôs it! ü•≥ Now that you have all the basics set up, you can connect Permit to a demo application and see your defined policy come to life.
