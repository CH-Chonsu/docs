### Single Tenant Mode

You can pass a tenant identifier for every `permit.check()` call you perform,
but for cases where you have a single tenant, you can use the `tenant` parameter in the SDKs `init()` function to specify the
tenant to be used as a default.

:::tip
This can be useful in multi-tenancy scenarios, where you have a default global organization to which people belong to.
