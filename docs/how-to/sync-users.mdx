title: Sync Users
---

This section aims to explain how new users are created within Permit.
In short, Users can be added and managed via the [User Management](/how-to/sync-users#via-the-user-management-screen) screen,
or by using the supported [SDKs](/how-to/sync-users#via-the-sdks).

Before we dive in, let's first understand the difference between **Users** and **Members**

## Users vs. Members

When using Permit, it is crucial to distinguish between two important categories: **Users** and **Members**.
Understanding this difference will help you map out and properly implement your authorization layer.

### Users

The term **Users** refers to the end users of your application. These are the entities (Humans or automated entities) whose access you want to control.

Each user has an identity that can be authenticated and authorized to access certain resources.
Users are assigned to [tenants](/overview/glossary#tenant) (each user can belong to more than one tenant) and can then be assigned roles and permissions.

The [User Management Element](/embeddable-uis/element/user-management) allows you to create an embeddable UI for user management.
Through this UI, users can manage their own access (With pre-defined limitations) as well as invite other users and assign various roles.

We do plan to release a [Policy Editor Element](https://permitio.canny.io/feature-requests/p/policy-editor-element),
which will allow users to define their own policies within safe limits. That being said, you can still produce such
interfaces on your own for end-users via using the [Permit API](https://api.permit.io/v2/redoc) -
and even govern access to these interfaces with Permit itself (for example, in a separate environment).

### Members

The term **Members** refers to your team members - the people who work alongside you within the Permit app.
Members are governed by Permit's own access control ([Authorization for Authorization](/overview/glossary#authz-for-authz-aka---meta-authorization)).

By default, only members get access to Permit and can author/edit policies.

## Syncing users into Permit

Now that we have a clear understanding of the difference between Users and Members, let's talk about adding new users into Permit.
There are two primary ways of doing so:

The [User Management](/how-to/build-policies/policy-basics#users) screen, and the `sync.user` function in our SDKs.

### Via the User Management screen

1.  In Permit, navigate to the [User Management](https://app.permit.io/user-management) screen via the navigation bar.

    ![User Management Button](/ui-videos/how-to/sync-users/1.png)

2.  In the top right corner, click on ![Add Users Button](/ui-videos/how-to/sync-users/2.png)

    :::note
    The new user will be created in the currently selected [tenant](/overview/glossary/#tenant).
    Each tenant is a separate, isolated unit with its own set of users, data, configurations, and permissions.
    If you are using multiple tenants, make sure to select the relevant one.
    :::

3.  Fill out the "Create a new user" form

    ![Create User Form](/ui-videos/how-to/sync-users/3.png)

    This form consists of:

- **Key**: A unique identifier that will distinguish your user from others.
  When using authentication solutions, this will usually be the user's [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier).

- **Personal Info**: The email, first, and last name are used to easily identify the user within Permit's UI. You can also leave these fields blank.

- **Role Based Permissions**: If you have already defined [Roles](/how-to/build-policies/policy-basics#roles) that your user can be assigned, you can assign the new user with the relevant roles here.

- **Permissions on Related Resources (ReBAC)**: This section allows you to assign the newly created user with an instance role for creating ReBAC policies.
  [Read more about creating ReBAC policies here](/how-to/build-policies/rebac/building-rebac-policies).

4.  Once you're done, click "Save". That's it!
    The newly created user will now appear in the User Management screen.

### Via the SDKs

Generally, creating users via the SDK requires the use of a single function - `sync.user`.

:::note
The `sync.user` function should be used for initial user creation. If you are creating a user from scratch, or importing one from your authentication solution, this is the function you need to use.
:::

Once the user has been synced with Permit, you should not use this SDK call to update the user's role. Instead, you should use the `assign.role` function.

:::info sync.user vs. create.user

It is important to note the difference between the `sync.user` vs. `create.user` functions. While `create.user` allows us to create a new user, this newly created user will have no role assigned to them.
This function is intended for specific use cases where no role assignment is necessary as part of calling the function.

:::

Usually, your existing users, as well as new ones, will originate in your authentication solution.

We [integrate with any authentication solution](/integrations/authentication/your-authentication) and provide the `sync.user` function for all of our SDKs.

A detailed explanation of how to use the `sync.user` function with each of our SDKs [is available here](/category/supported-sdks). The `sync.user` function will consist of:

#### Parameters

`user` - An object that contains the information about the user.

#### A Payload

`key` - A unique ID by which Permit will identify the user for permission checks.\
You will later pass this ID to the [`permit.check()`](/how-to/enforce-permissions/check/) API. You can use anything for this ID - the user email,
a [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier), or anything else as long as it's unique on your end. The user key must be url-friendly (slugified).

`email` (Optional) - The email of the user. If synced, it will be unique inside the environment.

`first_name` (Optional) - First name of the user.

`last_name` (Optional) - Last name of the user.

`attributes` (Optional) - User attributes are used to enforce attribute-based access control policies. You can read more about [how to define these attributes here](/how-to/build-policies/abac/defining-attributes).

Here's an example of the sync.user as defined for the NodeJS SDK:

```
{
    key: "key",

    email: "email@example.com",

    first_name: "John",

    last_name: "Smith",

    attributes: {}
}
```

The final implementation depends on the language of the SDK.
