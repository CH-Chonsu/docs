# Attribute-Based Access Control

## What is ABAC?

**Attribute-based access control** is an authorization model that **evaluates attributes** (or characteristics),
rather than roles, to determine access. The purpose of ABAC is to **allow users to define more complex access-control rules**
to prevent other users from unauthorized actions â€” those that don't have "approved" characteristics as defined by an
organization's security policies.

A simple example of an ABAC rule is defined below.

Employees that are based within the **European Union** can perform any action on **GDPR Protected Document**.
