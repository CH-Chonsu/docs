Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC) policies determine access based on the relationships between users and resources.
Constructing ReBAC policies involves defining these relationships and specifying the associated permissions.

## Before you start

Before you begin molding your own ReBAC policy within Permit, it's essential to establish a clear understanding of the various
relationships that exist within your system, as these will form the core of your policy. Identify the key subjects
(users or entities) and objects (resources) and how they interact with each other, mapping out both direct and indirect
relationships.

Consider the nature of these relationships, whether hierarchical, peer-to-peer, or something more complex.
You should also have a grasp of the specific permissions that correspond to different relationships, and a thorough
understanding of the overall system architecture.

Having a well-defined set of roles and attributes for both subjects and objects can further refine the policy.
Assessing these prerequisites and having a detailed understanding of the relationships within your system ensures a
robust and effective ReBAC policy that aligns with your organization's needs and security requirements.

## Building a simple ReBAC Policy with Permit

The Permit policy editor is very flexible for creating all types of policies, including policies as complex as ReBAC. Here is a
step-by-step guide to creating your own simple ReBAC policy using the UI.

### Create a basic role

If we want to create any type of role derivation or roles for particular resources - we need basic roles to be defined. Here we are
just creating a simple `Admin` role.
