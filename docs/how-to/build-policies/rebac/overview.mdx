title: What is ReBAC?
---

ReBAC, or Relationship-Based Access Control, is an access control model where permissions to access certain resources
are determined based on the relationships between the user and the resource. Instead of relying solely on predefined
roles or attributes of users and resources, ReBAC considers the relationships between them.

## Real-life ReBAC examples

Here are two real-life scenarios where Relationship-based access control would be implemented to enforce user actions.

### Example #1: Social Media Platform

On Facebook, a user might set their photo album's privacy settings to be viewable only by "Friends of Friends."
Here, access to the photo album is not just based on direct relationships ("Friends") but also an indirect relationship
("Friends of Friends").

### Example #2: Collaborative Document Editing Platform

Alice and Bob are working on a project report in Google Docs. Alice creates the main document, and Bob adds supplementary
material as an appendix in a separate document. Alice then links Bob's appendix to the main report. Now, anyone with
permission to edit Alice's main report should also automatically gain permission to edit Bob's appendix because of the
linkage (or relationship) between the two documents.

Check out this [Google Drive example](/modeling/google-drive) being modeled with Permit.

## Basic definitions

### Role Assignment

Role Assignment refers to the act of designating specific roles to individual users or entities, effectively granting them
the permissions associated with those roles. Roles represent a collection of permissions. By assigning a user a particular role,
you're essentially giving them access to all the permissions bundled within that role.
This mechanism simplifies access management, especially in large systems or organizations, as administrators only need to
manage roles rather than each specific permission for every user.

#### Example

In a company, new employees in the marketing department might be assigned the "Marketing" role, which provides access to
relevant databases, software, and internal websites without having to configure each access permission individually.

### Resource Role

A Resource Role is a specialized role that's specifically tied to a particular resource.
This means that the role, and the permissions it carries, is relevant only in the context of that specific resource.
By creating roles based on resources, organizations can have fine-grained control over who can access and modify specific items.

#### Example

In a cloud storage solution like Google Drive, a "Document Editor" role for a specific document might grant permissions to edit
and comment on that document. However, having the "Document Editor" role for one document doesn't mean the user can edit all
documentsâ€”only the specific one they're assigned to.

### Role Derivation

Role Derivation is the process or mechanism by which new roles are formulated using existing roles as a foundation.
This can be useful in hierarchical systems where higher-level roles encompass the permissions of several lower-level roles.
Role derivation helps in creating roles that are a combination or subset of other roles, providing flexibility and ensuring
that the principle of least privilege is maintained.

#### Example

In a software development company, there might be a basic "Developer" role that grants access to coding tools and
repositories. A new "Lead Developer" role could be derived from the "Developer" role but with added permissions, like code
review or project management tools. The "Lead Developer" role would, therefore, have all the permissions of the "Developer"
role plus some additional ones.
