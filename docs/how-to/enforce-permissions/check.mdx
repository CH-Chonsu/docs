title: Basic Checks
---

There are many ways to use the `permit.check()` function within permit to enforce permissions. This can depend on the policy
you are checking against and the granularity of the enforcement you need. Below we will talk about the different ways to
compose the `check` function.

## Simple check

The most basic enforcement you can create within your app is a simple Role-based Access Control (RBAC) policy.

The function accepts three parameters, a unique `user id`, and `action` and a `resource`.

```js
const permitted = await permit.check("john@permit.io", "create", "document");

if (permitted) {
	console.log("John is PERMITTED to create a document");
} else {
	console.log("John is NOT PERMITTED to create a document");
}
```

## Simple check with tenant definition

Tenants are silos or resources and users. You can pass a tenant as part of the resource object inside the `permit.check()` function.

```js
const permitted = await permit.check("john@permit.io", "create", {
	type: "document",
	tenant: "companyA",
});
```

:::note An illustrative use-case
You create two tenats. `Tenant A` and `Tenant B`. You can have the same user `john@permit.io` in both tenants, but the user might have
a different role. John may be an `Administrator` in `Tenant A`, but he could be an `Admin` in `Tenant B`.

## Enforce with attributes

As your company grows, you permissions will need to get much more granular, and you might have to check for specific attributes
on a user or a resource to determine the conditions for which you will allow an authorization check to pass.

If you will need to check for conditions as you perform an enforcement, you will be working with the Attribute-based access control
policy. Here, you can define extra attributes as part of the `user id` or `resource` by passing in a whole object.

If you want to learn about the different ways you can load data into Permit, check out the guide **[here](/how-to/manage-data/loading-data)**.

```js
const permitted = await permit.check(
	// the user object
	{
		// the user key
		key: "john@permit.io",
		// just-in-time attributes on the user
		attributes: {
			location: "England",
			department: "Engineering",
		},
	},
	// the action the user is trying to do
	"create",
	// Resource
	{
		// the type of the resource (the resource key)
		type: "document",
		// just-in-time attributes on the resource
		attributes: {
			hasApproval: "true",
		},
		// the tenant the resource belong to
		tenant: "companyB",
	}
);
```

## Enforce based on relationships

As your system complexity increases, you will need to levarage Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC) to incorporate
relationship checks into your enforcement. Unlike ABAC, ReBAC evaluates relationships between entities, enhancing the granularity
of access controls.

You can configure all the relationships and their structure by following the **[UI guide](/how-to/build-policies/rebac/building-rebac-policies)**
or via the **[API guide](/api/rebac/rebac-api-calls)**.

In the code example below, we are checking if `John` has the `assign` permissions on a member group resource (that we defined in
Permit beforehand).

```javascript
await permit.check(userId, "assign", `member_group:${group}`);
```
