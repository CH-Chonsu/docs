title: Loading Custom Data
---

There are multiple ways you can load data into Permit, and we will cover all of them below.

## via a user in the UI

When navigating to the user interface, you have the option to edit the user attributes for each unique user. These attributes

## via the `permit.check()` function

## via the API

Permit offers a beautiful API editor for dealing with structuring your policies, looking into audits, managing your
team members and so on. It's important not to forget that the whole no-code UI is fully **API driven**, meaning you can
automate any of the actions.

:::note
You can find the whole redoc referencing all the API functionality [here](https://api.permit.io/v2/redoc).
:::

In the meanwhile, let's look into some shortcuts that can be accomplished with the use of the API.

### Dynamically adding actions to every new resource in the same request

Add `default_resource_actions` to your env settings like this (note that you need to set the `permit_env_api_key`).

Here is the example code:

```bash
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://api.permit.io/v2/projects/:project_id/envs/:env_id' \
--header 'authority: api.permit.io' \
--header 'authorization: Bearer permit_env_api_key' \
--header 'origin: https://app.permit.io' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{"settings":{"default_resource_actions":["read","write"]}}'
```

## via Git

## via OPAL

**OPAL Scope Config (custom data sources)**

With the new Scope Config API, you can set your own data sources for your GitOps policy, and combine [Permit.io](http://permit.io/)'s ease of use, with OPAL's customizability.

Use the[ https://api.permit.io/v2/projects/{proj_id}/{env_id}/opal_scope](https://api.permit.io/v2/projects/%7Bproj_id%7D/%7Benv_id%7D/opal_scope) to modify the OPAL Scope used. (you can get the environment and project id with API requests <https://api.permit.io/v2/redoc#tag/Projects/operation/list_projects> note that you need org level API key to access those, you can create one here <https://app.permit.io/settings/api-keys> )

By default, Permit loads data about users, roles, and so on to OPA from the Permit cloud. You can use this API to load additional data sources to use in your custom policy.

In this example, we will load data about countries of the world of [https://restcountries.com](https://restcountries.com/).

**Set custom data sources using the [Permit.io](http://permit.io/) API**:

```
curl --location --request PUT '[https://api.permit.io/v2/projects/{project_id}/{env_id}/opal_scope](https://api.permit.io/v2/projects/%7Bproject_id%7D/%7Benv_id%7D/opal_scope)' \

--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \

--header 'Accept: application/json' \

--header 'Authorization: Bearer permit_key_***' \

--data '{

     "data": {

          "entries": [

               {

                    "url": "<https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all>",

                    "dst_path": "/countries",

                    "config": {

                         "headers": {

                              "Accept": "application/json"

                         }

                    }

               }

          ]

     }


}'
```

In order to see the new data you can request the data path from your local PDP like this

curl --location --request GET '<http://localhost:8181/v1/data>' \

--header 'Authorization: Bearer permit*key* {{secret}}'

API Docs for Scope Request (API still in beta):

![](/img/features/projects-and-env/scope-api.png)

You can view the full OPAL Scope documentation here:[ https://docs.opal.ac/getting-started/running-opal/run-opal-server/data-sources](https://docs.opal.ac/getting-started/running-opal/run-opal-server/data-sources)

**Custom scopes are supported from PDP \*\***v0.2.15, \*\*so you may need to run: docker pull permitio/pdp-v2:latest

And the following flag needs to be enabled when you run the container:

_OPAL_SPLIT_ROOT_DATA=1_

**E.G if you run it with docker:**

docker run -e PDP*API_KEY=permit_key*\*\*\* -e OPAL_SPLIT_ROOT_DATA=1 permitio/pdp-v2:latest

This is it, you now have a running instance of PDP with custom scopes!

You can also use the custom data source in your rego like this (if you have the gitops feature enabled for you):

data.countries[0].capital == "Bridgetown"
