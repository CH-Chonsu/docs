description: "How to deploy the Permit PDP to Prod"

When deploying to production, you might want to work with a local PDP (A Policy-Decision-Point microservice) within your VPC.
The PDP is easy to install via Docker, and will ensure **zero-latency, great performance, high availability, and improved security**.

:::note
Below is a summary of the how to deploy the Permit PDP, however, for the full guide, please follow the **[Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart)**.
:::

## Installing the sidecar

Pull our PDP container from Docker Hub [(Click here to install Docker)](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/):

```sh
docker pull permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

Run the container & replace the `PDP_API_KEY` environment variable with your API key.

```sh
docker run -it \
  -p 7766:7000 \
  --env PDP_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY> \
  permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

## Using the sidecar

The sidecar will listen on port `7766` by default, so all you have to do is to set your PDP_URL in our SDK initialization to
`http://localhost:7766` and you're good to go.

For example in Node.js:

```js
const permit = new Permit({
	pdp: "http://localhost:7766",
	token: "<YOUR_API_KEY>",
});
```
