## The idea ðŸ’¡

The CEO of Permit.io - **[Or Weis](https://il.linkedin.com/in/orweis)** - while on his previous venture @ **[Rookout](https://www.rookout.com/)**, ended up rebuilding access-control five times,
for a product that wasn't even three years old. It drove him crazy - so together with Co-Founder - **[Asaf Cohen](https://il.linkedin.com/in/asafc)** - they decided
to solve this once and for all.

They both saw a huge opportunity here; aside from the clear pain they felt themselves, it was easy for them to see that permissions are
the 3rd part of the **IAM** (**Identity Access Management**) waterfall; with each of its previous tiers creating several multi-billion
dollar companies.

They started by exploring and investigating the space. Asaf brought in his experience working at Meta & Facebook
(where they invested a team of ~30 people for half a decade to cover their authorization needs).
On top of their own experience, they interviewed multiple dozens of developers and security managers in companies big and
small (e.g. Cisco, Booking.com, Armis, Monday, JP Morgan, ChanZuckerberg, as well as smaller startups) to get as much insight as possible.

## Why did we create Permit.io

We at the Permit.io team have been building software for decades, working in dozens of companies of all sizes.  
We had one thing in common in all of these companies: we wrote, refactored, and debugged the same access-control code.

While access-control, permissions, and authorization requests are core to the product, they are also not unique to a specific product!

This is a good thing: they share the same core principles and are being written over and over for no good reason. We always wanted it to
be **plug&play** and easily upgradeable without changing our code. That's what we've built for you at Permit.io - the permissions infrastructure for the internet.
