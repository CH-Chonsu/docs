## Add the SDK to your Python code

Initialise the **Python SDK** and check for permissions.

1. Install the Permit.io SDK

```
pip install permit
```

2. Import the SDK into your code

```python
from permit import Permit
```

3. Create a new instance of the SDK.
   You can find instructions on getting a secret API key in the previous section.

```python
# This line initializes the SDK and connects your python app
# to the Permit.io PDP container you've set up.
permit = Permit(
    # in production, you might need to change this url to fit your deployment
    pdp="http://localhost:7766",
    # your secret API KEY
    token="<your-api-key>",
)
```

## Check for permissions using the API

You can run a permission check with `permit.check()`, passing in 3 arguments:

- `user_id`: a unique string id that identifies the user doing the action.
- `action`: the action performed.
- `resource`: the resource (object) the action is performed on.

In the following example we are checking that a user with the unique id `john@smith.com` can `create` a `document` resource.

```python
permitted = await permit.check("john@smith.com", "create", "document")

if permitted:
    print("John is permitted to create a document")
else:
    print("John is NOT PERMITTED to create document!")
```

:::tip REMEMBER

In cases where you are dealing with more than one tenant in your application, `permit.check()` can take a 4th argument, that being
the tenant object.

`tenant`: a unique tenant id or tenant name that you have defined within Permit.

It's also **important to remember** that each one of these 4 arguments are context based, but **they can be more arbitrary values**.
This means that if you wish, **for each argument you can pass in an object**, with attributes assigned to them.

:::

```python
const permitted = await permit.check("userId", "action", "resource", "tenant");
```

Permission checks are being run against the PDP container that's running locally on your machine - offering
minimal latency and without leaving your network.

This means that your user data **never** goes outside your system, **keeping security high**.

<!--
## Write API

Running `permit.write()` will perform API calls against the Permit cloud and will modify
the state of permissions and other objects in the system.

### Sync user (create a user in the permissions system)

Before being able to check permissions with `permit.check()` -
Permit must be able to identify the user and attach permissions and roles to that user.
In order to declare a new user in the system, use `permit.api.sync_user()`:

```python
user = {
    "key": "john@smith.com", # can be any unique string
    "firstName": "John", # optional
    "lastName": "Smith", # optional
    "email": "john@smith.com", # optional
}
await permit.write(permit.api.sync_user(user))
```


### Sync user with initial roles

If you want to **attach** a role to a user in the same API call you can define _initial_ roles by adding a **role key**.
Each item in the _initial_ role list will include a role key (the role name) and a tenant key.

```python
user = {
    "key": "john@smith.com",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Smith",
    "email": "john@smith.com",
    # John will be assigned the admin role in the default tenant upon creation
    "roles": [{"role":"admin", "tenant": "default"}]
}
await permit.write(permit.api.sync_user(user))
```

:::note
If a user with such key already **exists** in Permit, **we will not override** the user roles and Permit will **ignore** the role key completely.
:::


### Create a tenant

Tenants represent user and resource boundaries in your system. Typically if you are building
a multi tenant SaaS application where you are serving multiple customers from the same software
instances, _tenants_ allow you to create a **boundary** around one customer (i.e: tenant) such that users outside
the tenant cannot access the tenant's associated resources.

Every one of your customers is typically a tenant that contains only that tenant's users.

To create a tenant, use `permit.api.create_tenant()`.

```python
cool_company_tenant = {
    "key": "cool_company_inc",
    "name": "Cool Company Inc"
}

await permit.write(permit.api.create_tenant(cool_company_tenant))
```


### Assign a role

You can assign a role to a user in a given tenant.

```python
await permit.write(
    permit.api.assign_role("john@smith.com", "viewer", "cool_company_inc")
)
```


### Chaining multiple mutations together

You can chain multiple write operations (**_or mutations_**), and `permit.write()`
will run them according to the order you specify.

```python
# runs the mutations in order:
await permit.write(
    # first creates the user "john"
    permit.api.sync_user({
        "key": "john@smith.com",
        "firstName": "John",
        "lastName": "Smith",
        "email": "john@smith.com",
    }),
    # then, creates the "cool_company_inc" tenant
    permit.api.create_tenant({
        "key": "cool_company_inc",
        "name": "Cool Company Inc"
    }),
    # finally, assigns the role "admin" to user "john" on the tenant "cool_company_inc"
    permit.api.assign_role("john@smith.com", "admin", "cool_company_inc")
)
``` -->

## Full app example

Assuming a Python app made up of a single file, with the `permit` and `FastAPI` modules installed.

Create a new directory for your new python project.

```
mkdir hello-permissions && cd hello-permissions
```

Optionally, create a new virtual environment for your project - you might need to install `pyenv` and `virtualenv`.

```
pyenv virtualenv permissions && pyenv activate permissions
```

Now install the Permit.io SDK. We will also install the `FastAPI` and `Uvicorn` packages in order to run an HTTP server in our example.

```
pip install permit==1.0.0rc1 fastapi "uvicorn[standard]"
```

Create a file called `test.py`.

```
touch test.py
```

Copy the following code inside `test.py` and replace with your `API KEY` and `user-object`.
You can find instructions on getting a secret API Key in the previous section.

```python
import asyncio

from permit import Permit
from fastapi import FastAPI, status, HTTPException
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse

app = FastAPI()

# This line initializes the SDK and connects your python app
# to the Permit.io PDP container you've set up in the previous step.
permit = Permit(
    # in production, you might need to change this url to fit your deployment
    pdp="http://localhost:7766",
    # your API KEY
    token="[YOUR_API_KEY]",
)

# This user was defined by you in the previous step and
# is already assigned with a role in the permission system.
user = {
    "key": "john@smith.com",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Smith",
    "email": "john@smith.com",
} # in a real app, you would typically decode the user id from a JWT token

@app.get("/")
async def check_permissions():
    permitted = await permit.check("john@smith.com", "read", "document")
    if not permitted:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail={
            "result": f"{user.get('firstName')} {user.get('lastName')} is NOT PERMITTED to create document!"
        })

    return JSONResponse(status_code=status.HTTP_200_OK, content={
        "result": f"{user.get('firstName')} {user.get('lastName')} is PERMITTED to create document!"
    })

```

Now that your application is ready, let's run it!
Go to your applications localhost live deployment to see the outcome of the permission check.

```
uvicorn test:app --reload --port=<YOUR_LOCALHOST_PORT_NUMBER>
```
