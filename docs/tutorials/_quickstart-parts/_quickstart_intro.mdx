In this tutorial, we will show you how to integrate **Permit.io** with your application in just a few simple steps.

## Setup your PDP (Policy Decision Point) Container

We provide you with a **Policy-Decision-Point** - aka an authorization microservice, as a container for you to use.
Please follow the steps below to **install** and **run** the container on your local machine.

### 1. Pull our PDP container from Docker Hub

If you do not have Docker installed as of yet, **[click here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)** to install Docker.

```
docker pull permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

### 2. Get the Permit.io API key

Navigate to the **[Projects](https://app.permit.io/project-management)** page with the **Permit.io** web interface.
Find the active environment that is marked with a green dot on the icon. **Copy the Secret Key**.

In the left navigation panel inside the **Permit.io** app, click on your user icon and **copy** the **SDK API Key**.

	alt="Copy secret key from Projects management"
	data-zoomable
/>
<br />
<br />

Alternatively, you can navigate to the **Projects** panel, and underneath an existing project, for each environment, you will
be able to access and copy an environment specific **SDK API Key**.

:::note PLEASE NOTE
The SDK API KEY that is available for you to copy from your main user icon is the API Key that reflect the current project and
the current environement you are in.
:::

For each environment, you also have the option to **Rotate the API Key**, revoking access to the old API key and issuing
a new one.

:::warning
If there are any permission checks left in your code that are still using the old API key, they will immediately be denied.
**Your end users could potentially lose access.**

### 3. Run the container

Remember to **replace** `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with the **Secret Key** you have just obtained in the previous step.

```
docker run -p 7766:7000 --env PDP_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY> permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

:::info
Congratulations! You should now have a PDP container running. You can always check the status of the container
by typing `docker ps` in your terminal.

Let's now add the Permit SDK to **[your app](/tutorials/onboarding/connect-your-app)** or use the following demo example below.
