In this tutorial, we will show you how to integrate **Permit.io** with your application in just a few simple steps.

## Get your Permit.io Environment API Key

### Via the projects screen

1. Open the [Permit.io Dashboard](https://app.permit.io).
2. Navigate to the **Projects** screen.
3. Find the project and environment you wish to connect to.
4. Click on the context menu of the environment at the top right corner of the environment card.
5. Click on the **Copy API Key** option.

### From the user menu on the sidebar

You can quickly copy the Environment API Key of the active environment by clicking on the user menu and then on the **Copy SDK API Key** option.

:::info Remember
The API Key that you will copy from the user menu is linked to the active environment on the sidebar.
Switching to another active environment and then clicking on the **Copy SDK API Key** option will copy a **different** API Key - the API key of the newly activated environment.

## Setup your PDP (Policy Decision Point) Container

We provide you with a **Policy-Decision-Point** - aka an authorization microservice. It's available as a docker container for you to use,
or we can provide you with a cloud version for quick experimentation.

<Tabs groupId="pdp">
<TabItem value="cloud" label="Cloud PDP" default>

It is extremely simple to utilize the cloud PDP. As part of the initialization of the Permit instance, you need to pass
the cloud PDP URL.

:::note
The cloud PDP is great for quick experimentation with Permit, to learn how the service works and to quickly integrate the SDK.

However for production deployments it is best to deploy the Docker Container PDP - for better latency and availability.

**For time being, the cloud PDP does not support ABAC** (Attribute-based Access Control).
:::

```js
// This line initializes the SDK and connects your app
// to the Permit.io Cloud PDP.

const permit = new Permit({
  pdp: "https://cloudpdp.api.permit.io",
  // your API Key
  token: "[YOUR_API_KEY]",
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="container" label="Container PDP">

Please follow the steps below to **install** and **run** the container on your local machine.

### 1. Pull our PDP container from Docker Hub

If you do not have Docker installed as of yet, **[click here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)** to install Docker.

```
docker pull permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

### 2. Run the container

Remember to **replace** `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with the **Secret Key** you have just obtained in the previous step.

```
docker run -it -p 7766:7000 --env PDP_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY> permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

:::info
Congratulations! You should now have a PDP container running. You can always check the status of the container
by typing `docker ps` in your terminal.

Let's now add the Permit SDK to **[your app](/tutorials/onboarding/connect-your-app)** or use the following demo example below.
