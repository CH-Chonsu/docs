In this tutorial, we will show you how to integrate your app with Permit.io in a few simple steps.

## Setup Your PDP (policy decision point) container

We provide you with a Policy-Decision-Point - aka an authorization microservice, as a container for you to use.
To Install it, follow these steps:

#### 1. Pull our PDP container from Docker Hub ([Click here to install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/])):

```
docker pull permitio/pdp:latest
```

#### 2. Get the Permit.io API key

Navigate to [Project management](https://app.permit.io/project-management).  
Find the active environment with the green dot on the icon.  
Click on the "Copy secret key" button of the active environment.

Or:
Click on your user icon on the top right of the screen and click "Copy SDK secret key".

#### 3. Run the container (replace `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with your API key):

```
docker run \
  -p 7000:7000 \
  --env PDP_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY> \
  permitio/pdp

```

Now that you have a PDP container running

Add the Permit SDK to [your app](/tutorials/connect_your_app) or use the following demo app
