# Frequently Asked Questions | Permit.io

**What is permit.io?**  
Permit.io is the permissions infrastructure for the internet.
A fullstack authorization solution enabling developers to bake-in access-control into their products
within minutes and have them ready for future demands from customers and regulation.

Our developer SDK integrates with your app and enables you to add declarative permission
checks that are as easy to use as feature flags.

Our solution is built upon strong open source foundations, enables Git-Ops out of the box,
and goes far beyond enforcement - providing seamless access control **experiences** meant
for humans that simply work out-of-the-box: User Management, API Key management, Audit, User impersonation and so on.

**What is the difference between AuthZ and AuthN?**  
While closely related AuthZ and AuthN are very different things.
To simplify with a metaphor - imagine someone about to enter your home:

- **Authentication (AuthN) - Who is the user**  
Deals with identifying who is at the door, and deciding whether they may enter.
Also known as login.

- **Authorization (AuthZ) - What is the user allowed to do**  
Deals with the policy and permissions someone has once they enter (e.g. can they eat in the kitchen? Can they use the toilet? May they sleep in the bed? Can they read your diary? Can they drink all the rum and burn the house down? Can they invite their friends to reenact the battle of Gettysburg in your linen closet?)

**Is there a free version of Permit.io?**  
Of course! Our community version provides authorization capabilities up to 1,000 monthly active users. The best part? It’s free forever.

**What's the difference between OPA+OPAL and Permit.io?**  
Permit.io is a full-stack-authorization solution - covering all the layers required for building access-control for products and services - Infrastructure (e.g. Policy-engines, SDKS, APIs), Backoffice (the controls the team behind the product needs), and end-user interfaces (e.g. user management, audit logs, api-keys, ...). 
A key part of Permit.io’s infrastructure is the open-source combo of OPA+OPAL. 
OPA (Open-Policy-Agent) is a generic policy based decision engine, and OPAL (Open-Policy-Administration-Layer) is a realtime solution to keep policy agents updated with the policies and data they need, in an event-driven distributed fashion. 
When you use Permit.io’s authorization microservices you get OPA+OPAL as a builtin default.

**Can I use other policy-agents with Permit.io (e.g. OSO, Casbin)?**  
Yes, please contact us at [support@permit.io](mailto:support@permit.io) or join our [slack](https://bit.ly/opal-slack) to learn more about these use cases. 

**Can I Connect my FGA/Google-Zanzibar solution with Permit.io (e.g. AuthZed, Ory Keto, Auth0 Sandcastle)?**  
Yes, please contact us at [support@permit.io](mailto:support@permit.io) or join our [slack](https://bit.ly/opal-slack) to learn more about these use cases.
