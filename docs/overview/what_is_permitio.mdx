## What is Permit.io?

Permit.io is the permissions infrastructure for the internet. A fullstack authorization solution enabling developers to bake-in access-control into their products in minutes and have them ready for future demands from customers and regulation.

### Fullstack-Authorization

In the end of the day authorization isn't just about how our software enforces access; it's about the experiences dev teams and their users have with the software. For these experiences we require three parts:

1. Infrastructure - The centralized control plane, SDKs, APIs, and microservices we need to add to our software to create decision points and enforcement points.

2. Backoffice - The controls, both code and no-code, the team behind a product needs to develop, maintain, and govern it. We empower developers so they can easily empower the rest of their team (e.g. product, security, compliance, support, sales, â€¦)

3. Interfaces -The experiences we need to provide to the end user - so they can actively take part in how they connect to the product and other people using it.

But combining all three layers Permit.io can deliver an end to end solution, covering all your access-control needs. So you won't have to build anything - unless you want to.

### Permit.io vs OPAL

Permit.io is a full-stack-authorization solution - covering all the layers required for building access-control for products and services. A key part of Permit.io's infrastructure is the open-source combo of OPA+OPAL.

- OPA (Open-Policy-Agent) is a generic policy based decision engine
- OPAL (Open-Policy-Administration-Layer) is a realtime solution to keep policy agents updated with the policies and data they need, in an event-driven distributed fashion.

When you use Permit.io's authorization microservices you get OPA+OPAL as a builtin default.

#### Realtime Permissions

One of the key challenges Permit.io solves using OPAL is synchronizing between the authorization layer, the application, and the various data-sources.
Consider a simple policy like - &quot;Only users that have paid for a feature should have access to it&quot;.
The information on who has paid, would usually be managed by a third party service (Such as Stripe or Paypal). We'd want changes in those services to propagate to our authorization layer as soon as possible, so they can enable / disable access accordingly.
OPAL provides this through its event driven architecture.
