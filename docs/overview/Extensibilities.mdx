When choosing a stack to implement access control on, one of the questions arises is where will it break? 
Each develoepr have specific cases that requires specific handling.

## OPAL + GitHub Coupling

The OPAL server configured to track policy changes and pass them to the policy agents through the OPA client.
Having said that, and in case you are working with another source control for your policy, the OPAL server can support it.

Please join our [slack](https://bit.ly/opal-slack) or contact us at [support@permit.io](mailto:support@permit.io) to learn more about these use cases.

## OPAL + OPA Coupling

OPAL client is built as a side-car to OPA.

If you want to work with another policy-agents e.g. OSO, Casbin, please join our [slack](https://bit.ly/opal-slack) or contact us at [support@permit.io](mailto:support@permit.io) to learn more about these use cases.

## OPAL + My data source
Some of the policies rely on data that arrives from propietery datasources, databases, S3, etc.
To extend OPAL to support policy enforcement from such sources, you can build your own OPAL client data fetcher.
View more details on how to [extend opal data fetchers](https://github.com/permitio/opal/blob/master/docs/HOWTO/write_your_own_fetch_provider.md).

## Permit.io tech stack
Permit SDK is built in a way that a new language can be added in 1-2 weeks. 
We've added support for Java and C# in 2 weeks.

## OPAL - RBAC or ABAC?
While OPA supports an ABAC, for some users RBAC might be enough.
For such cases, OPAL can work with AuthZed, Ory Keto, Auth0 Sandcastle.
Please join our [slack](https://bit.ly/opal-slack) or contact us at [support@permit.io](mailto:support@permit.io) to learn more about these use cases.
